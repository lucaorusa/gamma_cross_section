Please acknowledge the use of these tables by citing the paper: Phys. Rev. D 105, 123021. If you want to add these tables to a public code, please add the readme file available at this link(https://github.com/lucaorusa/gamma_cross_section) to the folder where the tables are located.

In this repository are contained the tables with the energy differential cross section d\sigma_{ij}/dE of gamma rays for cosmic-ray (CR) component i and interstellar medium (ISM) component j. Here j are protons (Z=1,A=1) and Helium (Z=2,A=4). The first column of each file contains the kinetic energy per nucleon of the incident CR T_{projectile} and the second column the energy of the gamma ray E_{\gamma}, both in GeV. The following columns contain the energy differential cross sections of various possible CR isotopes in units of mb/GeV. These are total cross section, i.e. including all the possible contributions. In 'supplementary_table_gamma_best_fit.dat' are contained the energy differential cross section of gamma rays, in 'supplementary_table_gamma_upper_band.dat' is contained the upper 1-sigma uncertainty band, and in 'supplementary_table_gamma_lower_band.dat' is contained the lower 1-sigma uncertainty band. To read all these tables is sufficient to use the python script 'script_supplementary.py'. Details of its usage are reported in the script.
